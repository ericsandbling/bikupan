## Apiary
<!-- #apiary -->
<!-- swe-SV: bigård -->
<!-- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiary -->

The [_apiary_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apiary), derived from the Latin word _"apis"_ meaning bee, and describes the location where beehives and honey bees are kept. Apiary is another word for bee yard.

## Bee Space
<!-- #bee-space -->
<!-- swe-SV: bigång -->


_Bee Space_ defines the gap or space the bees naturally need to be able to move freely around on the combs in the hive.

The _Bee Space_ is used by the Apiarist to regulate where the bees build combs and put propolis.

The term is popularly credited to [Rev. Lorenzo Lorraine Langstroth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L._L._Langstroth) who made great use of the discovery that spaces smaller than the _Bee Space_ is often filled with propolis by the bees, and larger spaces with combs.
