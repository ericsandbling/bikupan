# Bee Hive

This document establishes a baseline for the hive design part of the _openApiary_ repository.

## Executive Summary

<!-- This section shall state the main goals and objectives of the _**Bee Hive**_ part of the _openApiary_. -->

The _Bee Hive_ shall provide a sustainable, ecologically conscious way for the apiarist to interact with the bees in order to:

1. Maintain bee health
2. Monitor bee health and life-cycle
3. Facilitate harvesting of bee products

The Bee Hive shall further encourage the apiarist to:

1. Interact with the bees on their own terms
2. Sustain the natural life-cycle of the bees

## Introduction

This section shall provide a background for and introduction to some basic assumptions and concepts that will be used in the design of this Bee Hive.

## Input Requirements

This section shall detail input requirements identified for the _Bee Hive_.

## Features

This section shall establish a comprehensive list of features included in the Bee Hive. The features in this section shall constitute the intended tools used to accomplish the goals and objectives set forth in the [Executive Summary](#executive-summary) section of this document.

### Overview (list)

This subsection shall provide an overview of all defined features in this document. The purpose of this overview is to provide searchability and visibility of all features.

|:---       |:---          |:---           |
| F-BH-0001 | [Renewable Material Design](#renewable-material-design) | The _Bee Hive_ shall be constructed completely of renewable materials. Parts where renewable materials are not available, such as electronics components, shall be considered and designed from a sustainable perspective. |

### Details

This subsection shall provide details of each feature included in the _Bee Hive_.

Each feature detailed shall include:
 * **ID:** Feature identifier to uniquely identify the feature for traceability. The ID shall have the format: `F-BH-xxxx`, where `xxxx` is an increasing number zero-padded to always include four (4) digits.
 * **Name:** Short descriptive name or title of the feature, to easily identify and name the feature.
 * **Description:** Concise and succinct description of the feature, what it does and how it works.
 * **Benefit Hypothesis:** A clear and measurable benefit to motivate the inclusion of the feature.
 * **Acceptance Criteria:** A set of criteria designed to facilitate determination if the feature can be deemed fulfilled in implementation terms.

Each feature defined shall be developed within its own subsection.
