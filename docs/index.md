# Open Apiary
<!-- Eric Sandbling, https://github.com/ericsandbling -->

A sustainable and ecologically conscious bee husbandry system designed for rational bee keeping.

## Introduction

The purpose of this repository is to develop a system for sustainable, ecologically conscious as well as rational bee husbandry.

At the outset of the project this is intended to include hive design as well as [ICT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_and_communications_technology) systems surrounding the hive and the bee husbandry as a whole. ICT in this context might include features such as remote monitoring systems as well as cloud base diary tools for the apiarist.
